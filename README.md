# AndroidAssignmentSQL
Basic application made in Android Studio that makes use of SQLite.
This is for an assignment I'm doing in my Diploma of Software Development course.

This application contains a login prompt activity and a product database editing activity. You can login and add and delete products from a list and set the cost of each product.

Tapping an product will retrieve the cost of the product. If you hold tap onto a product, it will ask you if you want to delete that product. You can also delete all current products with the delete all button.
